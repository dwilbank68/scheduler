#SchedulerX

 
by David Wilbanks


will get a decent name when I think of one.


The inspiration came about from a problem that arose at my previous job, when too many people were lining up to use too few machines.

In our case, the machines were high-end video tape machines -- but **SchedulerX** could be used to schedule almost any other resource, from washing machines to graphic workstations, to telescopes.

In short, you put yourself in a queue to use the machine you want, and all members of the queue are notified when it is their turn.

A quick video tutorial is available at [www.davidwilbanks.net](www.davidwilbanks.net).

###Features

1.	**SchedulerX** can contact you via email or SMS (or both) when it is your turn in the queue.
1. You can attach notes on the machine itself (no more yellow sticky notes), or leave notes for other members of the queue.
1. You can disable a machine, and leave a note describing the problem. As a bonus, the machine glows with a cool red overlay.

###Coming Next

1.	**SchedulerX** will be able to contact you with voice call, to which you will be able to respond via a phone tree.
1. Realtime chat between members of the queue
1. New app or a new UI for a better mobile experience.
1. Socket.io push updates to the UI.
1. More frequent queue-checking on Heroku. (Heroku will only every 10 minutes on their free plan)
